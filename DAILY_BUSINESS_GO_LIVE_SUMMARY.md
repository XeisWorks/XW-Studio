## 📞 SUPPORT & ESCALATION

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Problem: "Printer not found"**
```
Solution: Run printer detection script
  → python -m xw_studio.core.printer_detect
  → Compare available vs configured printers
  → Update .env with correct printer name
```

**Problem: "API timeout"**
```
Solution: Check network + API status
  → Verify internet connection
  → Check API service status (sevdesk.de)
  → Enable request logging in config
  → Retry operation (auto-retry in place)
```

**Problem: "Fulfillment stuck"**
```
Solution: Check and recover from partial state
  → Check fulfillment flags in KV store
  → Verify which step failed
  → Retry individual step or full flow
  → Check error logs for details
```
