"""sevDesk refund / cancellation client.

Provides two operations used by the refund dialog:

1. ``cancel_invoice``  — POST /Invoice/{id}/cancelInvoice
   Creates a Stornorechnung (SR) automatically and books it.
   Source invoice status → "Storniert". Cannot be undone.

2. ``create_credit_note_from_invoice``  — POST /CreditNote/Factory/createFromInvoice
   Creates a Gutschrift DRAFT from an existing invoice (all items copied).
   The draft has zero accounting effect until sent/booked.
